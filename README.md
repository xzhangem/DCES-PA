# DCES-PA
DCES-PA: Deformation-controllable elastic shape model for 3D bone proliferation analysis using hand HR-pQCT images. CIBM, 2024. The codes can also be found at (https://data.mendeley.com/preview/thcr278ff4).    

Data is stored in MCP_mesh_volume. Metacarpophalangeal joint surfaces constructed from raw HR-pQCT volumes. It contains three part: 57 meshes of healthy joints (MCP2_health_mesh), 58 meshes with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and 15 test samples with pathologists' annotation of conspicuous proliferations. 

For the algorithm implementation and reproducing results based on the mesh input, please refer to README.txt in DCES-PA file.

If you want to try the HR-pQCT inputs, you can first segment the CT volume and get the joint mesh by using our previous method (https://github.com/xzhangem/HR-pQCT-Erosion-Detection).
